2.but we have 5 showing
The query returned 0 rows, meaning there are no crew members in the data who meet this specific condition: having 5 or more roster entries with roster_status = 'Not Awarded' (as defined by the grouping on employee, month/year, and not-awarded reason).
So if you’re “seeing 5 showing” somewhere else, it’s likely due to a different definition—e.g., total “Not Awarded” rows overall, or 5 in a specific month/year, or 5 without grouping by month/year and reason, etc. This query only shows crew who hit the threshold of at least 5 records per grouped combination, and none do.
