I want to find some details related to employee 101

No records were found for employee 101 (or AA-101) in the crew members table, so there’s nothing to report for their profile details, training records, benefits, or emergency contacts. This usually means the employee ID doesn’t exist in the system, is stored under a different identifier/format, or the crew member record is inactive/archived in a way that isn’t returned by this query.
