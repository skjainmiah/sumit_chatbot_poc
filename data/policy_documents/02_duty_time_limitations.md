# Flight Duty Period and Duty Time Limitations

## Overview
This policy defines Flight Duty Period (FDP) limits and cumulative duty time restrictions for American Airlines crew members in accordance with FAR Part 117.

## Flight Duty Period (FDP) Definition
FDP begins when a crew member is required to report for duty and ends when the aircraft is parked after the final flight segment.

## Cumulative Duty Limitations

| Time Period | Maximum Flight Time | Maximum Duty Time |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 24 hours    | 8 hours            | No specific limit  |
| 7 days      | 60 hours           | -                  |
| 28 days     | 100 hours          | -                  |
| 365 days    | 1,000 hours        | -                  |

## Flight Time vs. Flight Duty Time
- **Flight Time**: Block-to-block time (aircraft movement begins to movement ends)
- **Flight Duty Time**: Report time to block-in of final flight

## Extensions
- FDP may be extended by up to 2 hours due to unforeseen operational circumstances
- Extensions cannot be planned in advance
- Extensions can only be used twice per 168-hour period
- Crew members may decline extensions if fatigued

## Split Duty
- If a crew member is given a rest period of at least 3 hours in suitable accommodations mid-duty:
  - FDP may be extended by 50% of the rest period
  - Maximum extension is 2 hours

## Deadhead Transportation
- Deadhead time counts as duty time
- Deadhead time does NOT count as flight time
- If deadhead precedes an FDP, it's included in that FDP
- If deadhead follows an FDP, a new FDP begins

## Reserve Duty
- Airport standby: Counts as FDP from report time
- Short-call reserve: 2-4 hour response time
- Long-call reserve: 12+ hour response time

## Consecutive Duty Days
- Maximum 6 consecutive days of FDP
- After 6 consecutive duty days, minimum 24 hours off
