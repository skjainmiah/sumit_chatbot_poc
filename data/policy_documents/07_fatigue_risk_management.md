# Fatigue Risk Management System (FRMS)

## Program Overview

American Airlines maintains a comprehensive Fatigue Risk Management System to ensure crew alertness and flight safety. This program exceeds FAA requirements and incorporates scientific research on fatigue.

## Understanding Fatigue

### Types of Fatigue
1. **Acute Fatigue**: Short-term, resolved by single sleep period
2. **Cumulative Fatigue**: Built up over multiple days of inadequate rest
3. **Circadian Fatigue**: Due to working during low alertness windows

### Fatigue Risk Factors
- Time awake exceeding 16 hours
- Circadian low points (0200-0600, 1400-1600)
- Insufficient sleep (less than 7 hours in 24)
- Sleep debt over multiple days
- Time zone transitions
- Early report times
- Late finish times

## Crew Responsibilities

### Self-Assessment
- Evaluate fitness for duty before each report
- Use SAMN-PERELLI fatigue scale
- Consider sleep quality and quantity
- Assess cumulative fatigue

### SAMN-PERELLI Scale
1. Fully alert, wide awake
2. Very lively, responsive
3. Okay, somewhat fresh
4. A little tired, less than fresh
5. Moderately tired, let down
6. Extremely tired, very difficult to concentrate
7. Completely exhausted, unable to function

**Report if level 5 or higher**

### Fatigue Reporting
- Report fatigue concerns to scheduling
- Use confidential fatigue report system
- No punitive action for good-faith reports
- Follow up required within 72 hours

## Company Responsibilities

### Schedule Design
- Limit consecutive early starts
- Avoid circadian low window duties
- Build in recovery time after international
- Monitor cumulative duty hours

### Fatigue Monitoring
- Track fatigue reports by route/base
- Analyze trends quarterly
- Implement mitigations as needed
- Report to safety committee

## Controlled Rest Procedures

### In-Flight Rest (Augmented Crew)
- Minimum 2 hours rest opportunity
- Class 1, 2, or 3 rest facility required
- Crew must be available within minutes

### Controlled Rest (Two-Pilot Crews)
- Maximum 40 minutes in cruise
- One pilot must remain at controls
- Brief before and after rest
- Notify cabin crew

## Circadian Rhythm Management

### Eastbound Travel
- Exposure to morning light
- Avoid bright light in evening
- Adjust sleep schedule gradually

### Westbound Travel
- Exposure to evening light
- Nap before late duties
- Stay awake until local bedtime

### Layover Sleep Strategies
- Anchor sleep period to home time
- Split sleep if needed
- Minimize alcohol and caffeine
- Create dark, quiet environment

## Fatigue Countermeasures

### Effective Countermeasures
- Strategic napping (10-20 minutes)
- Caffeine (timing is crucial)
- Physical activity
- Bright light exposure
- Conversation and engagement

### Ineffective Countermeasures
- Loud music alone
- Cold air
- Eating
- Willpower

## Training Requirements

### Initial Training
- FRMS awareness (4 hours)
- Sleep science basics
- Fatigue recognition
- Reporting procedures

### Recurrent Training
- Annual FRMS refresher (2 hours)
- Case study reviews
- Policy updates

## Waivers and Exceptions

### Extension Requests
- Must be approved by FRMS committee
- Documented justification required
- Additional mitigations mandatory
- Limited to operational necessity

### Post-Waiver Review
- Fatigue report required
- Review within 7 days
- Patterns trigger schedule review
